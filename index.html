        <h4>Today marks the day that a new chapter in my life begins. I am transitioning away from blue-collar welding work, and into the tech industry. I have been a welder for over 7 years now, but the time has come for something new, something less harmful on my body.</h4>
        <br>
        <h4>I have many friends in the tech industry that have told me about all of the fun they have and interesting work they are tasked with. Throughout the last 6 months of speaking with them I have found a passion for coding and technology driven work. During this time I worked on learning as much coding as possible on my own. This has included many online courses and tutorials. Now I am ready for my next step. At the start of the new year I will officially begin coding school at a wonderful coding bootcamp in Seattle, Washington.</h4>

        <h4>As of today my home in Colorado is officially under contract. I have enrolled in a bootcamp called 'Code Fellows' in Seattle. My house is set for closing on December 30th and my classes are slated to begin January 6th. Over this next month many things in my life are about to change. I am moving away from my home state and the only state I have ever lived in previously. These are exciting but scary times.</h4>
        <br>
        <h4>I have found a place to live during my stay in Washington. Luckily I have a good friend from college who works as a control systems engineer for Beoing and has a home with a room for me. Living with him will be great as he is a wealth of knowledge in the subjects I will be learning, plus our dogs will finally be reunited!</h4>
